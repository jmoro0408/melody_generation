# Melody Generation
## Creating new melodies with RNNs.


This program uses the [ESAC Dataset](http://www.esac-data.org/) to generate new melodies based on simple folk songs using a recurrent neural network. It is a code along from The Sound of AI ["Melody Generation with RNN-LSTM"](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-wATfeyAMNr0KMutwtbeDCmpwvtul-Xz) youtube series.
